# Introduction to Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple virtual instances of a physical resource, such as a server, operating system, storage device, or network. These virtual instances (often referred to as "virtual machines" or "VMs") run on a physical machine known as the host, and each virtual instance operates as though it is a standalone system with its own operating system and resources.

#### **Types of Virtualization**

**Server Virtualization** : This is the most common form of virtualization. It involves dividing a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each running its own operating system and applications.

**Desktop Virtualization** : Allows a user to run multiple virtual desktops on a single physical machine or access them remotely. Users can run different operating systems and software on the same hardware without needing multiple physical devices.

**Storage Virtualization** : This combines multiple physical storage devices into a single virtual storage pool, making management easier and more flexible. It helps in optimizing storage utilization and improving efficiency.

**Network Virtualization** : Involves creating a virtual network that decouples network services from the physical infrastructure. This enables more flexible and dynamic networking setups.

**Application Virtualization** : Application virtualization allows programs to run in isolated environments. This makes it easier to run applications without needing to install them directly on the physical device. Examples include Microsoft App-V and VMware ThinApp.


# Introduction to Cloud

Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet, often referred to as "the cloud." Rather than owning and maintaining physical hardware and infrastructure, users can rent or lease these resources from a cloud service provider, paying only for what they use, often on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.

# Cloud Models (IAAS, PAAS, SAAS)

#### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In this model, customers rent IT infrastructure (such as virtual machines, storage, and networking) on a pay-as-you-go basis. The cloud provider manages the physical infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for managing the operating system, applications, and data.

**Examples of IaaS Providers:**

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), S3 (Simple Storage Service)

**Microsoft Azure**- Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Blob Storage

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** - Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage

#### 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS provides a platform and environment for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. It abstracts away hardware and OS management, offering pre-configured environments for application development, including databases, development tools, middleware, and runtime environments.

**Examples of PaaS Providers:**

1. Google App Engine

2. Microsoft Azure App Services

3. Heroku

4. Red Hat OpenShift

#### 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. The cloud provider manages everything, including the application, operating system, and infrastructure. Users access the software via a web browser without needing to install or maintain it themselves.

**Examples of SaaS Providers:**

**Google Workspace** (Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive)

**Microsoft 365** (Word, Excel, Outlook)

**Salesforce** (Customer Relationship Management)

**Slack** (Team communication and collaboration)

**Dropbox** (Cloud storage and file sharing)
