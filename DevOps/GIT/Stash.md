## Stash
`git stash`
It is used for hotfixes in branch (meanwhile there are changes in working copy) without commits and checkouts.<br>
Therefore it keeps changes in the working copy and the staging area and thus cleans them up.<br>
We can checkout another branch without committing or losing changes!

### Commands
- `git stash pop` = reapplies the saved working copy<br>

### Remotes
